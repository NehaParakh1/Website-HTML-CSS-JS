            Online education is a procedure of gaining skills and knowledge
            through electronic devices like computers, mobiles, laptops, etc
            using the internet. Online education makes it possible for tutors or

          Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that
          are 100% virtual. Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the
          internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a
          brick-and-mortar school building. It is a development in distance
          education that expanded in the 1990s with the spread of the commercial
          Internet and the World Wide Web.The importance of self-assessment
          through tools made available on educational technology platforms has
          been growing. Self-assessment in education technology relies on
          students analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and areas where
          improvement is possible to set realistic goals in learning, improve
          their educational performances and track their progress.

          Educational technology (commonly abbreviated as edutech, or edtech) is
          the combined use of computer hardware, software, and educational
          theory and practice to facilitate learning. When referred to
          with its abbreviation, edtech, it often refers to the industry of
          companies that create educational technology. In addition to the
          practical educational experience, educational technology is based on
          theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication,
          education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and
          computer science. It encompasses several domains including learning
          theory, computer-based training, online learning, and m-learning where
          mobile technologies are used.

          Educational technology is an inclusive term for both the material
          tools and processes, and the theoretical foundations for supporting
          learning and teaching. Educational technology is not restricted to
          high technology but is anything that enhances classroom learning in
          the utilization of blended, face-to-face, or online learning.[11] An
          educational technologist is someone who is trained in the field of
          educational technology. Educational technologists try to analyze,
          design, develop, implement, and evaluate processes and tools to
          enhance learning. While the term educational technologist is used
          primarily in the United States, learning technologist is synonymous
          term used in the UK as well as Canada.
